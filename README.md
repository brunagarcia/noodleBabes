# Stop-Sending-Noods

An arcade style noodle-themed game built using React and Web APIs.

In a world taken over by flying noods, what can you do?
Dodge! Dodge! Dodge!
How long can you survive?

Stop Sending Noods was created with Annie Ng and Bruna Garcias for a 1-Day Hackathon.

## My roles include the following:
+ gameplay animations
+ enemy generation & movement
+ player movement
+ player & enemy encounter calculations
